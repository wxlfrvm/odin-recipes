    <h3>One day, not having any gluten-free pasta on hand but lots of zucchini, I decided to use 'zoodles' instead of noodles. The whole family enjoyed it! I don't use any salt in the recipe because the cheeses already contain it. This dish is even better the next day and freezes well too.</h2>
    <p>ingridients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or mandolin.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Allow to set until remaining liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
